Also known as the Silicon Valley of India, Bangalore has an estimated population of 12.34 million in the metro area.It is now the 24th most populous city in the world and the fastest-growing Indian metropolis.\nSince,Bangalore is developing at good rate,the employment opportunities are also developing and this resulted in more inflow of people into city,which also led to increase in traffic and also the pollution.\nSo people usually prefer housing near to their worklocation.but the problem with this is the availability of the food of their choice.In our project we will be focusing on recommending the housing areas based on the choice of their food\n",
